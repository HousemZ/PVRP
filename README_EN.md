# Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP)

In France, home dialysis patients are managed by a "Home Healthcare Company" (HHC Company) which provides the necessary logistic
services. This company is responsible for the acquisition and installation of of the generator at the patient's home and the
delivery of consumables to the patient. Traditionally the patient is supplied once a month. This certainly requires a
considerable space for storage.

According to Rein Echos [2], one of the barriers that prevents many patients from accessing home dialysis is the limited space
to store consumables. The goal is to satisfy both the company by reducing the distance traveled per period and the patient by
reducing the cost of storage at the patient's home. However, a mathematical model can solve small size problems.
Thus, heuristics are needed to solve large size problems.

The problem is to find a trade-off between the increase in the number of clients which requires an increase in the frequency
of visits and the cost of transportation which requires that the frequency of visits be low.

We are faced with the challenge of solving a Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP).
